  # Maji Ndogo SQL project

## Project Overview

The Maji Ndogo SQL project is a four-part series project aimed at creating data-driven solutions to tackle the water crisis in the fictional country of Maji Ndogo. It focuses on building a comprehensive understanding of SQL, from fundamental to advanced functions and queries, while simulating real-world data analysis challenges for data analysts.

The project involves analyzing the md_water_services database, which contains over 60,000 records and 43 columns across 7 tables, using SQL to extract insights and inform data-driven decisions to address the Maji Ndogo water crisis.



## Problem Statement

The residents of Maji Ndogo face critical challenges, including insufficient water supply, deteriorating water service infrastructure, and contaminated water sources, among other issues. The analysis aims to solve this challenges using data.



## Methodology 

The analysis utilizes MySQL, ranging from basic commands like SELECT to advanced techniques such as CTEs, views, joins, and window functions, to transform raw data into meaningful insights. 

The project is structured into four parts, each requiring a strong understanding of SQL functions and their manipulation to maximize data insights.
